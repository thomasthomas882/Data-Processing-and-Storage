In-Memory Key-Value Database Assignment
Instructions for Running the Code:
Clone the repository using the command git clone https://github.com/yourusername/in-memory-db-assignment.git and navigate to the project directory with cd in-memory-db-assignment. 
Compile the code using g++ -o inmemorydb inmemorydb.cpp and run the executable with ./inmemorydb. Follow the prompts and observe the terminal output to understand the functionality of the in-memory key-value database.





Future Assignment Modifications:

To improve this assignment for potential official use, consider making the following modifications:
Clarify certain instructions to provide more detailed explanations of concepts like transactions and database state, ensuring a better understanding by students. 
Introduce additional methods that extend the functionality of the in-memory database, encouraging students to implement more advanced features such as querying, indexing, or transaction isolation levels. 
Specify clear grading criteria and provide sample test cases to facilitate effective assessment. Consider adding automated testing scripts to evaluate the correctness and efficiency of students' implementations.
Allow flexibility in language choice to encourage students to implement the database in languages other than C++, fostering a broader understanding of programming languages. Customize this README based on your specific preferences and the needs of your course.
